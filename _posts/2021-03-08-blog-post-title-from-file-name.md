## Cooking up a Storm

I've always loved cooking and exploring the different types of cuisine across the country and world. After my high school graduation, a group of friends and I ventured to Europe. We explored 5 different countries and tons of cities, and while the sites were beautiful and meeting people was much fun, what I remember most was the food. We traveled to many coastal towns and got to try tons of seafood. My favorite being in Spain.

Spain is famous for their paella, which is a rice dish with lots of yummy seafood like shrimp, mussels, and clams. After eating dinner and having some good laughs with friends, I did some further research on the dish and the fish we consumed. Shrimp, mussels, and clams are critical ingredients to this dish but also critical creatures in the ocean. Shrimp are decapods, meaning they descend and are related to lobsters, crabs, and prawns. Seeing the biological relationship between differnt seafish and thinking about their flavor profiles has been a really interesting way to think about the food I eat. As a chef, these relationships can be important to think about when constructing dishes. 

Even though our meal was quick to eat, the story behind it and the origins of its ingredients tells a long story.
