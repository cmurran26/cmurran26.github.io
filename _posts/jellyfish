##My friend peed on me

Cold, clear, crystal blue. The ocean waves looked so inviting on this Saturday afternoon in Laguna Beach, California. My friends and I, eager for a swim after an intensive game of beach volleyball, ran into the waves. We dodged waves and chunks of seaweed, making our way to the second set of waves on the beach. Surfers and swimmers swarmed around us and everyone was enjoying their fun day in the sun. After a fun 30 minutes, we grew fatigued and started to make our way out of the water. As I walked through the sand, suddenly I scream in pain and grab my foot. My friends run out of the water, scared at what just happend, and I follow them closely behind. 

Upont the shore, I inspect my foot to see that I've been stung by a jellyfish! In that moment, I recalled a fact that urine helps with jellyfish stings, but did I want my friend peeing one me? No. Did my foot hurt? Incredibly. I enlisted my closest friend who's just weird enough to go with it. He peed on my foot, but my foot didn't feel better at all. We had to call over the lifeguard who helped soothe the burn from the sting.

After we returned to the house -- my foot all bandaged up -- I stalked the interent only to learn that peeing on jellyfish stings is a complete myth and does, indeed, do nothing. I got peed on for nothing.
